    <h2>How to make yummy Onigiri Yaki</h2>
    <p>This is a dish a very close friend taught me how to make as I am an absolute anime freak and we both appreciate japanese culture and cuisine. 
       This dish is very versatile as you can make almost any filling to add to the centre of your onigiri creation.
    </p>

    <p>
       The main component to this dish is the sushi rice. Not just any rice will work, it has to be sushi rice for it to work. 
       The sticky consistency makes it easier to mold a nd shape to rice around your filling of choice.
