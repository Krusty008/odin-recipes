    <h2>How to make Flapperjacks</h2>
    <p>
        This is a tasty breakfast treat, but do not be fooled by its perceived simplicity as the fluffy texture comes with practice
    </p>
    <p>
        The secret to making perfectly fluffy flapjacks every time is not over mixing and patience when cooking an low heat. 
        I have learnt to wait for the bubbles to pop before flipping to ensure it become perfectly golden on both sides while preventing a raw centre.
